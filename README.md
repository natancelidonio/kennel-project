# Project Kennel, for learning and personal practice purposes

Welcome! This is a web project developed for a Chihuahua breeders' kennel, created as part of my learning journey with web development.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of Python and Django, applying what I've learned so far.

## About the Project

This site was made to practice and develop my web development skills. For now, it is under continuous development. It may cover:

- Django-based backend
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- CRUD operations for kennel management (dogs, breeders, litters, etc.)
- User authentication and authorization
- Photo gallery and contact form
...

All code was written as part of my personal growth. Part of the code was written by me, and part of the code I took from a course by Professor Luiz Ot√°vio Miranda (to whom I am very grateful).

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.13.1
- Django 5.2.5
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- SQLite
- MySQL
